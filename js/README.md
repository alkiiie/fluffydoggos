## Contributing code

Code contributions are welcome in this repository, and are encouraged to help optimise its performance.

Please keep in mind: This is not a repository that I am putting my main focus on (see my latest project [ignite](http://pti.aeunt.rf.gd) for that), so it will take me time to get to contributions.

----- Contributing JS -----

I encourage you to make contributions within the JS code as you think is in the best interest of this repository. Please keep the above in mind, and know that it will take time for me to get to these contributions.
