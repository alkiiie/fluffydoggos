## Uploading photos

Images can be uploaded to this repository by forking it and then uploading them.

To start, you need to make a new branch in your fork (**DO NOT USE THE MASTER BRANCH**). You can do so by following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).

Images **MUST** be in numerical order and in .png format (ex: 1.png, 2.png, 3.png).

When you have uploaded your images, open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with a short explanation and number range (e.g, 1-5, 6-10) of files you've uploaded.

I (XXRT5) will review your pull request when I can, and make space on the site to display your photo(s).

**Note**: I may remove or replace images that I believe are not appropriate or unsuitable for this repository. If I modify or remove photos that you have uploaded, I will notify you of this in your pull request.
