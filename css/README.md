## Contributing code

Code contributions are welcome in this repository, and are encouraged to help optimise its performance.

Please keep in mind: This is not a repository that I am putting my main focus on (see my latest project [ignite](http://pti.aeunt.rf.gd) for that), so it will take me time to get to contributions.

----- Contributing CSS -----

I encourage you to make contributions within the CSS code that you believe will benefit the site's performance. However, please note that I ahlready have a design layout for this project, and may not accept any major design modifications. If you are looking to modify the design or layout in any major way, please create an issue in this repository beforehand explaining your intentions.
